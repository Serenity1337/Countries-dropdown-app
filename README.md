# Countries-dropdown-app

After you clone or download the app, in order to run it, you have to first run "npm install" in the terminal in order to install the required dependencies. 
Once npm install finishes installing the dependencies, you have to run the command "npm run start" in order to run the project.

The app is very simple and consists of these three main functionalities:

1) We use fetch to an api to get countries+cities
2) You will be met by a dropdown which consists of all the countries from the API.
3) Once you select a country, you will be met by a 2nd dropdown, at first its invisible until you pick a country. The second dropdown contains all the cities of the chosen country.
